<h1>Only Child Resource Center: Is One Child Enough?</h1>
<p>While whatever choices — or circumstances — ultimately determine your family size, it helps to have a wellspring of research, articles and advice at your fingertips as you navigate possible options.

  Whether you’re exploring the right age to have a first child or wondering if you should add another child to your family, the selected articles can lead you to paths you might have not considered otherwise.

  In this section, you’ll find everything from what some suggest is the ideal age to have a baby, how children affect a mother’s income, the science behind sibling relationships to concerns about your child’s development without siblings.

  Facts to get you started:

  Across several studies, mothers of one appear to be happiest.
  Research shows that only children have an edge in key development areas.
  While once stigmatized, “older” first-time moms (and their children) reap benefits women who first give birth in their 20s are less likely to see.
  Single parenthood has not only become more common, but accepted — there are myriad reasons why single mothers and fathers provide the same amount of love, attention and resources as their coupled counterparts.
  Siblings and birth order do not impact development, personality, social skills, or academic success as dramatically as most people think (or try to tell you). How you parent is the key — not sibling status.</p>
